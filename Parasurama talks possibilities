The world seems as if cast in stone but underneath it all it is fragile, malleable, amenable to our will.

When you cast an arrow, you determine where it goes, its motion is planned by you. You leave no room for doubt. There is only one possibility.

Imagine though if you could harness all the possibilities, one arrow becomes many, a sword thrust becomes many thrusts.

Karna seems to make sense of it all. His warrior mind immediately spots a defect.

All the possibilities include the ones in which the arrow never leaves the bow, or ones in which the swords swing back on itself hurting the bearer.

Parasurama smiles, "That is where the training comes in, only keeping the relevant possiblities and discarding the rest".

It was hard to learn the skill. Karna simultaneously had to unlearn the skills he had learnt the hard way about being accurate, about being sure while remembering some of the lessons so that he himself would not be hurt.
Everytime he worked with possibilities it took something out of him. He had to use it as less as possible and yet be proficient at it.

He started small of course, nothing big. That was the only way skills were learnt, by treating nothing as sacred, not getting attached to what one already knows.

Karna I am sure you have must have heard the tales, Kshatriya after Kshatriya destroyed, whole armies. For a change they are all true. Do you wonder how one man managed to destroyed so many trained warriors.

Karna often wondered why Parasurama had done it. What could propel someone to cause destruction, to wipe out an entire caste.

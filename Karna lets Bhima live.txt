Bhima lays bruised and battered, probably for the first time in his life he has been overpowered with the mace in battle. He can feel his bones ache, his strength waning. One swing and his life is over. Karna knows this but for some reason he cannot bring himself to finish it. He cannot kill his younger brother even though it is his duty to do so. He sees the sun setting, he sees that the day's battle has ended. He walks off, disgusted with himself that he could not kill Bhima, the one who killed so many of Duryodhana's brothers, teared them apart limb from limb but Karna lets him live.

Duryodhana is furious.
"He was at your mercy and you chose to let him go."
"The sun had set, the day's battle was over" says Karna the excuse sounding feeble to even himself.
"Have you seen what they have done. You stick to a code where they have broken every one of the edicts of battle. They have killed my brothers, bespoiled their bodies and you adhere to a code. Did you not see the way they killed  Bhishma hiding behind that eunuch, how they chopped of Drona's head."
Karna doesn't know what to say. He cannot reveal the truth. That would make things worse
"Arjun will die tomorrow at my hand"



"I was at his mercy, he could have killed me but he did not. Such was his warriors code that he would not lay a hand on me after the sun had set"
"I have never felt such strength, Even Duryodhana with all his skill witht he mace never bothered me so. Balarama himself would have been proud of his skills"
"He is the greatest warrior I have ever fought against."

Everyone is present at Karna's funeral.
Yudhisthra still seems to be in a rage at just having killed an elder brother.
Ramdas has been summoned all the way from Anga.
He plays his Sitar, he plays the saddest tune he knows, his fingers knowing what to do, doing what they have done since he was a child but there seems to extra note of melancholy. He is in despair.
Kunti is stoic although the pain is apparent, her face is transformed at the death of her eldest. She seems to have aged 10 years in a day. The war has taken a heavy toll on them all. The victors don't feel as if they have won.
Ramdas is playing and all of a sudden the sounds increase, it is as if there is a symphony of Sitars playing the saddest, most melancholy tune they know. The gods themselves would be saddened.
Ramdas pays the ultimate tribute to his Guru with a superb display of the skill he was so painstakingly taught.
The sun shines and then fades away as Ramdas finishes his piece.
One of the greatest warriors to walk the Earth is dead.

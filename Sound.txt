Of all the senses, sound it seems is the most peculiar. It seems very abstract yet it functions as a much better indicator of things.
Karna too noticed this. He noticed that even if his eyes could not distinguish between two identical sets of bows and arrows, the merest drawing of the string would tell him more, the twang of the book, the sound it made as he nocked an arrow became the voice he trusted most.
He applied this to every weapon he practiced with. He noticed that when he would hit a bullseye, the slightest miss on his part undetectable to the naked eye would register with his ears. He began to hunt more and more for the perfect sound.
He began shooting in the dark, hunting deers fleet of foot and with sharp hearing themselves. This honed his hunters instinct, taught him the gift of silence, of patience and of waiting for the opportune time.
He was proud of his newly acquired skill.
Once it so happened that Parasurama asked him to go and hunt some deer for food. Karna obliged. With footsteps that barely made a sound even without trying, so used to nimbleness was he by now. He heard a sound, a deer drinking water he thought. He nocked an arrow, shot, he hit the target of course but he instantly knew something was wrong. The death didn't sound right. He rushed and found a Rishi by the water. He had put an arrow through his heart. 
The Rishi noticed his killer and in a fit of rage cursed him thus
"As you killed a defenceless Rishi so shall you die defenceless with not a weapon in hand bent to the ground".
Karna apologized profusely but to no avail. The curse stood. Karna walked back dejected.

I always wondered why he did not kill me when he had the chance. The sun setting seemed such a flimsy excuse. Now he knows. He could not kill a brother despite being a sworn enemy he backed out at the last instant and look at the rest of us bastards, we committed fratricide, I killed hundreds keeping a stone over my heart. Bhima is ashamed as this washes over him. He feels guilt but he knows that he did what had to be done. One cannot be sentimental in war.

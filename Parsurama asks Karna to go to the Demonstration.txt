You are now my equal, you might even be better than me.

There is a demonstration that the Princes of Hastinapur will have a short time from now. Anyone can showcase their skills, its an open event but no one does because the Princes are so much better that everyone else ends up looking foolish.
You will showcase your skills there. It will be good for you to feel the eyes of a crowd upon you as you bear your weapons. After all that any war will seem simple like a non entity.
What will I do there Acharya.
Oh you will simply replicate their feats nothing less nothing more but showcase your skills you must.
Your training is done, I have nothing more to teach you.

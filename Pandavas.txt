The pandavas are five. The Kauravas number to a hundred. Both sets of brothers are remarkable warriors, perhaps the finest of the age.
The Pandavas though have Arjun, the peerless archer, the likes of whom the world has not witnessed.
Perhaps the Kauravas being so many don't register in the imagination of the people. They are merely a statistic. The pandavas skills though the people seem to know intimately.
Yudhisthra the eldest excels with the spear in hand. Bhima the second, almost barbaric in size, the one with the appetite of the wolf is rightly the master of the mace, the heaviest weapon of them all. Only Duryodhana, eldest of the Kauravasa is his equal in the art of the mace. Arjuna, the third, Son of Indra is the one blessed with the looks and a way with the ladies. He is the archer one rumoured to be able to shoot in the dark with only sound as his guide. They say that finer hands have not been witnessed since Bhishma. Nakula and Sahadeva, the twin sons of Madri, the puniest of the Pandavas, master swordsman each of them. When they fight it seems as if they are mirror images. Both are blessed with an exceptionally keen insight of cattle and horses probably inherited from their Grandfather, Salya, the king of Madra.
The arena awaits them. Today is the day they display their skills after their years of toil under Dronacharya their precept and Guru.

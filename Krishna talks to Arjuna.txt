I beat him though right. I am the better warrior, the better fighter says Arjuna to Krishna
Krishna can only smile. You beat him when he was at his weakest, a victim of circumstances as he lay on ground trying to pull his chariot out of the ground.
Come lets go and visit your chariot.
Arjunaâ€™s chariot as might be expected is battered and bruised from the vagaries of war. Hanuman would you please get down from the chariot and Hanuman who has been perched atop suddenly appears in front of their eyes.
The chariot is dust, each of those blows by Karna would have destroyed the chariot had it not been Hanuman holding things together.
Arjuna is humbled.
